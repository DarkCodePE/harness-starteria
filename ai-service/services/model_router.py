"""Model selection and per-model cost estimation.

Single source of truth for which model an agent runs on and what it costs. Prices are
keyed by MODEL, not by agent: pricing every call at one model's rate was wrong in both
directions, and `agents/initial_reviewer.py:34-37` measured how wrong — on the real
json_schema workload, qwen3.6-flash cost $0.003-0.005/call (and failed 0/3) while
deepseek-v4-flash cost $0.0004/call (3/3 ok).

Unknown price returns ``None``, never a stand-in rate. "Unpriced" and "free" are different
claims, and a budget enforced on a fabricated number is worse than one that admits a gap.

NOTE: `agents/pdf_extractor/extractor.py` keeps its own OPENROUTER_MODEL_PRICING dict
(public API, re-exported). The deepseek-chat rates below are the same figures; unifying
the two tables is a separate change with its own blast radius.

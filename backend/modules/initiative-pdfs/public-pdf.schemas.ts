 *   - 10 MB cap (vs 50 MB authenticated) — landing-page decks are small.
 *   - PDF mime AND `.pdf` extension both required.
 *   - draftId / anonymousSessionId are opaque client-supplied identifiers;
 *     they are length-bounded and charset-restricted so they cannot be used as
 *     an injection vector into the storage path (storage.service also
 *     sanitises, this is defence-in-depth at the boundary).
